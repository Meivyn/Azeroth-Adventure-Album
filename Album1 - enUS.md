What is it, boy?\
Is this a bad war? I mean... worse than the others?\
Wars never change. Only the warriors do.\
Do you think this war is going to change the Horde?\
We will see, boy. We will see.\
I feel bad that the elves lost their tree.\
Why?\
You told me that we orcs once lost our home.\
That was long ago.\
Didn't it make everyone sad?\
We were... not ourselves. It is difficult to explain, boy.\
Mother spoke of it sometimes. I... I think it made her cry.\
